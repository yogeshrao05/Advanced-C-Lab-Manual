EXP NO:10 C PROGRAM TO FIND A SQUARE  OF NUMBER USING FUNCTION WITHOUT ARGUMENTS WITH RETURN TYPE

Aim:

To write a C program that calculates the square of a number using a function that does not take any arguments, but returns the square of the number.

Algorithm:

1.	Start.
2.	Define a function square() with no parameters. This function will return an integer value.
3.	Inside the function:
o	Declare an integer variable to store the number.
o	Ask the user to input a number.
o	Calculate the square of the number (multiply the number by itself).
o	Return the squared value.
4.	In the main function:
o	Call the square() function and display the result.
5.	End.
